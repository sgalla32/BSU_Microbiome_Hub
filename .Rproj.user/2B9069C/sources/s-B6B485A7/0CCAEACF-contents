# Borah

You can get a Borah account by contacting the [Boise State University HPC Team](researchcomputing@boisestate.edu). When asking for a Borah account, you will need to provide the following information:

- Request Account on the HPC SYSTEM: system name
- Project: Project Name or Grant Information
- Description of Research: Short description of research to be done on the cluster.
- Project PI Name: PIâ€™s-Name.
- Email Address of Requestor: user@boisestate.edu

Make sure that you let them know you need access to the BioCompute node, which is a node that is dedicated entirely to biology. This will ensure that your jobs get priority.

# Access to the Biocompute CIFS-Share

When you contact the HPC Team to create a Borah account, you can also ask them to add your credentials to the BSU Biocompute CIFS-Share. To access the CIFS-Share on a Mac, you can use the following:

- Click Finder
- Click on 'Go' -> 'Connect to server...'
- Type 'smb://cifs-prd-01/Research/BioCompute/' into the dropdown.
- Click 'Connect'

# How do download Anaconda and QIIME2 to your Borah account:

Anaconda is a program that helps with the installation of hundreds of genetic software for Linux.

First, we need to ssh (secure shell) to get onto Borah:

```markdown
ssh -XC username@borah-login.boisestate.edu
# Enter your password, then you're on Borah.
```

Now, we will download the script that installs the most current version of Anaconda. We will download this using wget:


```markdown
wget -O - https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/ 2>/dev/null | sed -ne 's@.*\(https:\/\/repo\.anaconda\.com\/archive\/Anaconda3-.*-Linux-x86_64\.sh\)\">64-Bit (x86) Installer.*@\1@p' | xargs wget
```

Now, we will execute this bash script using bash:

```markdown
bash Anaconda3-2021.05-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
Now, we will Install QIIME2 using conda. We will download a *.yml file using wget to do this:

```markdown
wget https://data.qiime2.org/distro/core/qiime2-2021.4-py38-linux-conda.yml

# Use conda to create an environment:
conda env create -n qiime2-2021.4 --file qiime2-2021.4-py38-linux-conda.yml

# Optional cleanup
rm qiime2-2021.4-py38-linux-conda.yml

# Test to see if it works, using conda activate:
conda activate qiime2-2021.4
conda deactivate 
```

# QIITA

Many of the data sets we are working with are found on University of California San Diego's site [QIITA] (https://qiita.ucsd.edu/). You can create an account here. Email Stephanie Galla [stephaniegalla@boisestate.edu](stephaniegalla@boisestate.edu) to ask her to add you to projects.
